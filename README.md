# Goromi Discord Bot
## Introduction
___
This is my attempt to make a what i wanted Mirai to be. it shall include the ability to play music. Ideally it should be able to play music from Youtube, spotify, soundcloud, apple music, (and maybe pandora). it should also be capable of managing things such as reaction roles.

## Setup
In order for the bot to work and not crash on startup you will need pass the token to the bot when you launch it in the form of `java -jar Goromi-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar TOKEN`.
